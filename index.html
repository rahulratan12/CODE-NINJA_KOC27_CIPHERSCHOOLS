                        <p>A single room is one of the most common types of hotel rooms you will find in every hotel</p>
                        <p>A 5-star hotel will typically offer guests several different room types, each featuring its own set of amenities, number of beds and layout.
                            The makeup of room types at a property is largely determined by the general demographics groups (i.e., business travelers, families, newly weds, etc.) that stay at the hotel. Hoteliers planning on adding or renovating rooms at their properties should have a thorough understanding of who their guests are before determining which types of rooms to prioritize.</p>

                        <p>If your hotel is located in a picture view destination, many of your guests may find it important that their room provides a great view of the surrounding area. Not every room at a 5-star hotel has a fantastic view of the city or countryside, which means hoteliers can place a premium on the ones that do.
                            Offering guests the option to select a room with a view can be a great source of ancillary revenue for all types of hotels, but this is especially the case for luxury properties.</p>
